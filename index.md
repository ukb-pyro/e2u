# Nvidia‚Äôs big short circuit

*How a power shortage could short-circuit Nvidia‚Äôs rise*
*The Economist, August 30th 2025 (Business | Schumpeter)*

---

**On August 27th Nvidia performed what has become a quarterly ritual beating of expectations.** Analysts forecast that the chipmaker would sell \$46bn-worth of semiconductors in the three months to July. It made closer to \$47bn. Its latest Blackwell graphics-processing units (GPUs), whose unrivalled number-crunching prowess has won over artificial-intelligence modellers, are flying off the shelves. So are its GB-series AI superchips, which combine two Blackwells with a general-purpose processor. Nvidia probably sold over 600,000 Blackwells and nearly as many GBs, nearly 20% more than last quarter, accounting for almost 60% of total revenue. It is on track to sell 2.7m and 2.4m, respectively, this year.

Nvidia bulls on Wall Street now reckon that America‚Äôs chip champion could be worth \$5trn before long, having become the world‚Äôs first \$4trn company only in July. It looks, in the words of many a breathless commentator, unstoppable. And yet fittingly for an unstoppable force, Nvidia is about to come up against an immovable object. Or at least an object that has not moved much in decades‚ÄîAmerica‚Äôs power grid.

---

### Current concerns

Energy has not historically been a constraint on computing. Even as rocketing internet traffic increased the workloads of the world‚Äôs data centres nine-fold between 2010 and 2020, their overall power use stayed completely flat. Every generation of chips was more efficient than the last. AI has turned this trend on its head.

* A non-AI data-centre computing unit, or rack, needs around **12 kilowatts (kW)** to run.
* An equivalent AI module requires **80kW when training LLMs** like ChatGPT, then **40kW when responding to prompts**.
* Nvidia‚Äôs Blackwell chips are the hungriest of all: **1kW each**, three times more than Hopper.

Racks contain dozens of them. Nvidia sells modules packed with **36 GB superchips (72 Blackwells + CPUs)**, designed to operate at **132kW**. A secondary cooling system can add **160kW per rack**.

---

### Tot it all up

Between February 2024 and February 2026 Nvidia will have sold some **6m Blackwells and 5.5m GBs**. Assume half end up in America. If installed and operated at capacity, those chips would raise American power demand by **25 gigawatts (GW)** ‚Äî nearly double all new US utility-scale capacity added in 2022, and close to the 27GW in 2023. And that‚Äôs before Rubin (next-gen) chips, AMD rivals, or EVs are factored in.

A global survey of data-centre managers by **Schneider Electric** found that *power and transmission capacity* is their #1 concern ‚Äî more than access to GPUs themselves.

* Bernstein forecasts a US power shortfall of **17GW by 2030** (if efficiency improves) or **62GW if it does not**.
* Morgan Stanley estimates a **45GW gap by 2028**.

---

### If power doesn‚Äôt keep pace

* **Chips could sit idle**, hurting AI titans like Microsoft and Alphabet.
* **Chip sales could stall**, dragging Nvidia down.

Neither scenario is priced into current valuations. Investors assume utilities will rise to the challenge.

---

### The utilities‚Äô response

The sector is stirring:

* Capex of the 50 biggest US electricity providers rose **30% (to \$188bn)** since 2022.
* They plan **123GW** of new plants on top of today‚Äôs 565GW.
* But only **21GW** is actually under construction.

Meanwhile, equipment makers have cut investment by 3% annually since 2022. Tariffs could make gear pricier. Utilities remain dividend-heavy: **\$87bn paid since 2023** instead of reinvesting. And as regulated monopolies, higher spending means higher bills ‚Äî politically toxic.

---

### Workarounds

Some hyperscalers are hedging:

* Alphabet ‚Üí adding solar + batteries at data centres.
* Meta ‚Üí Louisiana project partly powered by on-site natural gas.

But the grid still supplies nearly all US electricity. Without its expansion, Nvidia‚Äôs epic surge will sooner or later power down.
